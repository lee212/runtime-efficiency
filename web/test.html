<p><h1>Draft page for cloud run-time efficiency measurement</h1>
As a first step of measuring the preparation stages for cloud environments, we have collected timestamp between the processes of RAIN and the processes are:<br><br>
<li> Eucalyptus</li>
<ol>
	<li>Image preparation - time between available image and Rain client launched.</li>
	<li>Launching images - time taken for launching VM instances and waiting them to be running.</li>
	<li>SSH accessibility - time for allocating public IP/private IP addess(es). The IP address(es) should be accessible via SSH and this measured time-value indicates between requests and availability of the address(es).</li>
	<li>Total walltime - entire processing time</li>
</ol>
<li>OpenStack</li>
<ol>
	<li>IP address association - time for associatin VM instance(s) and ip address(es)</li>
	<li>Mounting/configuring directories - Configuring ssh in VM and mounting home directory (using sshfs) in /tmp</li>
	<li>Running jobs - ? (/tmp/N/u/jdiaz/exit.sh) </li>
	<li>Rest of them are same as Eucalyptus</li>
</ol>
</p>
<li>Spiderweb chart</li>
* Logarithm is applied to display time-value.<br>
* Legend shows like this 'client' + '_' + 'platform' + '-' instance + 'number of vm requested' + '_' + 'sequence number of request'<br>
e.g. rain_euca-1_1 - first request(try) of Rain client for Eucalyptus with 1 VM instance.<br>
* In case the graph doesn't show up, please refresh(F5) the browser. Highchart sometimes doesn't load html element correctly.

<p>Figure 4. Processing time of Rain for Hadoop<br>
* Hadoop cluster indicates time taken to setup and configure Hadoop environments in the home directory for example, fg-hadoop.job_setup, job_genconf, and job_start are performed in order.</p>
